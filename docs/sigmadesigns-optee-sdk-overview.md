# 2. Introduction

The OP-TEE SDK is generated based on OP-TEE v2.3.0 release by using toolchains:

    AARCH32 toolchain: gcc-linaro-5.3-2016.02-x86_64_arm-linux-gnueabihf
    AARCH64 toolchain: gcc-linaro-5.3-2016.02-x86_64_aarch64-linux-gnu

Please refer to [Guidance on sdesigns ARM GNU/Linux toolchain](http://avenue.sdesigns.com/depts/RD/Teams/DTV/Wiki/Guidance%20on%20sdesigns%20ARM%20GNU%20Linux%20toolchain.aspx) for more details on ARM toolchains.

Secure OS is built in aarch64 mode, and TAs are built in aarch32 mode.
Host components are provided in diverse flavors, with each prebuilt by certain cross compiler of either aarch64
or aarch32 mode, which gives client applications the flexibility to choose different cross compilers and
execution state as well, aarch64 or aarch32.

# 3. TEE API extensions

## Introduction

We have to extend GP Core API by adding several TEE APIs mainly for:
* enable TAs play with necessary platform specific drivers (OTP,PMAN)
* fit for particular use cases (user remap).

In order to avoid collisions with TEE APIs, all extended TEE APIs are collected in libuteex.

Please refer to `tee_api_ext.h` for details.

## Extended API List
|TEE_API_EXT| Notes |
|-------|----------------------|
|`TEE_Ext_Init`|Optional|
|`TEE_Ext_DeInit`|Optional|
|`TEE_Mmap`||
|`TEE_Munmap`||
|`TEE_OtpWrite`|ULI TA accessible only|
|`TEE_MemState`||
